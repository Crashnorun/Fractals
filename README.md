## Intro
A fractal is a mathematical or logical pattern with certain special characteristics, which, when plotted out graphically,will give you a shape with special characteristics. 
A fractal is a complex shape made up of other shapes. If we take each one of these sub-shapes from which a fractal is made, we will see that they are all copies of the shape as a whole. This is known as self-similarity.
